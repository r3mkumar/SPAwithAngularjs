## assignment 2
this assignment is to create a "check off" shopping List application.

Think of being in a store with a shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list.

## assignment 3
You are going to be building a much simplified search of the menu item descriptions using the restaurant server REST API we used in Lecture 25, Part 2.

The idea here is for the user to search the descriptions of menu items. Then, given the list of matches of his search, give the user the ability to throw the items they for sure don't want off the list, thus narrowing it down to what they do want.

Your task is create a text box and a button with the label "Narrow It Down For Me!".

## assignment 4

Super simple idea behind this week's assignment: use the restaurant menu REST API to create a master/detail view pair.

Your application should have 3 views (i.e., 3 view states): home (home), categories list (categories), items list (items).
